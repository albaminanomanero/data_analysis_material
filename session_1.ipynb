    "### 1. Overview of setup and installation \n",
    "**What is **R**?**\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a domain-specific, high-level programming language (i.e., easy for humans to read and interpret) created in the early 1990s by statisticians *R*oss Ihaka and *R*obert Gentleman (any clue on where the name is comes from?). Designed specifically for statistical computing and data visualization, R serves as a robust environment for analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data—particularly useful in academic, economic, and business contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "R emphasizes data-centric thinking, making it natural to manipulate datasets, perform statistical operations, and generate publication-ready graphics. Though not a general-purpose language like Python, R excels in its intended domain, supporting procedural and functional paradigms with syntax tailored to statistical workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "R’s power lies in its packages, including the popular Tidyverse, which streamline tasks like data cleaning, transformation, and plotting. It is widely used in research, public policy, economics, healthcare, and finance, and remains a top choice for data-intensive analysis and reproducible research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why **R**?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is purpose-built for data analysis, statistics, and visualization.\n",
    "- R is free, open-source, and supported by a strong academic and professional community.\n",
    "-  integrates easily with tools like Excel, SQL, and Python, and supports advanced analytics including machine learning and forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How R differs from other languages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike Python or Java, R is not general-purpose—it’s designed specifically for statistical computing.\n",
    "- R’s syntax is optimized for data and model-oriented tasks, reducing the need for complex programming constructs.\n",
    "- R includes thousands of specialized packages (like the Tidyverse) that streamline analysis for non-programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, R can feel less intuitive at first for beginners, and installation or package compatibility may require attention. By the end of this course, you’ll have the minimal foundation needed to use R effectively in academic, business, or research settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why moving from spreadsheets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility: Code provides an explicit, version‑controlled record of every step—unlike point‑and‑click spreadsheets.  \n",
    "- Scale: Programming supports loops, functions, and scripts, making it easy to automate repetitive or complex tasks.  \n",
    "- Transparency & Debugging: Errors in code are easier to detect, test, and fix compared to hidden spreadsheet formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remote use on Binder** \n",
    "\n",
    "I have created a Binder environment that you can access online through your web browser. This platform allows you to run R sessions and work with all the course materials without needing to install anything on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may take a little time to load initially, Binder is the best option for us to share the exact same setup, ensuring everyone is working with the same software and files. This helps avoid compatibility issues and makes collaboration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that Binder instances are ephemeral. This means you can experiment freely with the code and data during your session without affecting the original files. However, once you close the session, all your changes will be lost unless you download a local copy of your work. So, if you want to save your progress, be sure to export your files before ending the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it’s still a good idea to have R and RStudio installed locally on your desktop for more flexibility and faster performance when you’re working independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access it [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/albaminanomanero/data_analysis_iseg/HEAD) or in [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/) by looking to putting in the search tab ''albaminanomanero/data_analysis_iseg''. All material of the course will be posted there and on the class Team. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Binder Start](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albaminanomanero/data_analysis_iseg/refs/heads/main/imgs/binder_1.png)\n",
    "1. Menu Bar:\n",
    "   - File: options related to files and directories\n",
    "   - Edit: options related to editing documents\n",
    "   - View: options  that alter the appearance of JupyterLab\n",
    "   - Run: options for running code.\n",
    "   - Kernel: actions for managing kernels, which are separate processes for running code. \n",

    "5. Right-side bar:\n",
    "   - Property Inspector: Displays metadata and settings for the currently selected notebook cell (e.g., tags, slide type).\n",
    "   - Kernel Usage: Shows CPU/RAM consumption and allows you to manage the active kernel (restart, shut down, etc.).\n",
    "   - Debugger: Offers breakpoints, call stack navigation, variable inspection, and step‑through controls when debugging code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local installation via Conda**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can install R directly from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/). This installation equips us to write and run R code directly from the command line or R’s basic console. However, this approach can be quite unintuitive for beginners just starting with programming or data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironments (IDEs) and editors come in. They provide a more user-friendly interface for writing, organizing, and running code. Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and project management make programming more efficient and accessible at any skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "While R has its own native IDE called RStudio, in this course **we will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) rather than RStudio**, because VSCode is a very versatile editor that supports almost any open-source programming language with just a few clicks. This flexibility means you can continue using the same environment as you expand your programming skills beyond R.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install R, you get a core set of functions, but much of R’s power comes from its packages—extensions developed by the community that add specialized functions, data types, and tools. For example, packages like **tidyverse** provide tools for data manipulation and visualization, while others support statistical modeling, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, managing packages and their dependencies can sometimes lead to conflicts or version issues. That's why to make sure everyone uses the local setup, we will follow an installation with Conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure we all work in the same environment, we will not install R directly. Instead, we’ll use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), a Python and R distribution that includes the Conda package and environment manager. This allows us to install everything we need—R itself, plus all required packages—in a controlled and reproducible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Anaconda**  \n",
    "   Download and install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install VSCode**  \n",
    "   Download VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). VSCode will serve as our IDE for both Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download the Environment File**  \n",
    "   Download the `environment.yml` configuration:  \n",
    "   [https://github.com/albaminanomanero/data_analysis_iseg/blob/main/environment.yml](https://github.com/albaminanomanero/data_analysis_iseg/blob/main/environment.yml)\n",
    "\n",
    "   This file includes everything needed to recreate the same R environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Terminal (Windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   ####  Windows\n",
    "   Use the **Anaconda Prompt** (not the regular Command Prompt):\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Click on the **Start** menu.\n",
    "   2. Type `Anaconda Prompt` in the search bar.\n",
    "   3. Click to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will launch an Anaconda terminal with Conda already configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   ####  macOS\n",
    "   Use the built-in **Terminal** application:\n",
    "   1. Open **Finder**.\n",
    "   2. Go to **Applications > Utilities**.\n",
    "   3. Double-click on **Terminal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Alternatively, press `Cmd + Space` to open **Spotlight Search**, type `Terminal`, and hit `Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Change the directory to the folder where we have stored the downloaded file**\n",
    "   Type `cd path/to/environment`, where `path/to/environment` is the folder containing the environment configuration file in the terminal (i.e, Downloads folder)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create environment**:\n",
    "   Type in the terminal: `conda env create -f environment.yml` \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check installation**:\n",
    "   Type in the terminal to activate the environment: `conda activate data_analysis_iseg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**  \n",
    "> If you choose to install R using the base installation from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), you’ll need to manually install and load each required package on first use. For example:\n",
    "> ```r\n",
    "> install.packages(c(\n",

    ">   \"IRkernel\",     # R kernel for Jupyter\n",
    ">   \"essentials\",   # essential R packages\n",
    ">   \"readr\",        # data import tools\n",
    ">   \"readxl\"        # Excel import\n",
    "> ))\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. R Notebooks with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we’ll write and run **R** code interactively using **Jupyter Notebooks**—either locally in VSCode or remotely via Binder. Both options give you the **exact same environment** and workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an open‑source project providing **computational notebooks** that combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code cells** (here, R code via the IRkernel)  \n",
    "2. **Markdown cells** for narrative, equations, and images  \n",
    "3. **Outputs** (plots, tables, printed results)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks capture your entire analysis—code, results, and explanations—in a single shareable `.ipynb` file (JSON under the hood), which you can version‑control, export to PDF/HTML, or open in any Jupyter‑compatible interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Ways to Use Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **VSCode**  \n",
    "   - Open VSCode  \n",
    "   - Install the R and Jupyter extensions (`R`, `R LSP Client`, `Jupyter`)  \n",
    "   - **File → New File → Jupyter Notebook**  \n",
    "   - Select the `data_analysis_iseg` Conda environment and the **R** kernel  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binder**  \n",
    "   - Go to the Binder link provided  \n",
    "   - It launches the **same** `data_analysis_iseg` environment in your browser  \n",
    "   - No local installation required  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Both VSCode and Binder use the **IRkernel** under the hood, so your notebooks behave identically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Toolbar**  \n",
    "  Run cells, restart the kernel, save, etc.  \n",
    "- **Cell types**  \n",
    "  - **Code**: write R code (plots, data manipulation, models)  \n",
    "  - **Markdown**: document your workflow with text, lists, equations  \n",
    "  - **Raw**: uninterpreted content for export  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution**  \n",
    "  - Press **Shift + Enter** or click ▶️ to run a cell.  \n",
    "  - All cells share the same R kernel—variables and functions persist until you restart.\n",
