    "\n",
    "1. **Create Frequency Tables and Bar Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Using the dataset, create a frequency table for the variable of `Monthly wage (Eur)`\n",
    "   - Plot a bar chart of `Monthly wage (Eur)`.\n",
    "   - Interpret the distribution from the frequency table and bar plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Histograms and Skewness**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Plot a histogram of `Monthly wage (Eur)` using `ggplot2` with `binwidth = 500` (or an appropriate bin size).\n",
    "   - Create a second histogram with the `aes(y = ..density..)` to show the density instead of frequency.\n",
    "   - Based on the histogram and desciprive statistics, determine whether the wage distribution is skewed to the right, left, or symmetric.\n",
    "   - Explain how the histogram shape matches the skewness value from the descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpret a Pie Chart**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a pie chart representing the categories of `Monthly wage (Eur)` (group values into ranges if there are too many unique values).\n",
    "    - **Do you think the pie chart is misleading?** If so, explain **why**, based on the limitations we've just discussed (e.g., too many categories, similar slice sizes, difficulty distinguishing colors).\n",
    "    - What are some alternative visualizations that would represent the same data **more clearly**?"
